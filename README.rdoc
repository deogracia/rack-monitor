=Rack::Monitor

Rack::Monitor is Rack middleware collecting run-time information for 
monitoring tools like Munin.

==Installation

 $ sudo gem install rack-monitor

==Basic Usage

Rack::Monitor is implemented as a piece of Rack middleware and can be used with
any Rack-based application. If your application includes a rackup (`.ru`) file
or uses Rack::Builder to construct the application pipeline, simply require
and use as follows:

 require 'rack/monitor'

 use Rack::Monitor if ENV['RACK_ENV'] == 'production'

 run app

==Using with Rails

Add this to your `config/environments/production.rb`:

 config.gem "rack-monitor", :lib => "rack/monitor"

 require 'rack/monitor' #Rails bug?
 config.middleware.use Rack::Monitor

You should now see `Rack::Monitor` listed in the middleware pipeline:

 RAILS_ENV=production rake middleware

==Monitoring with Munin

Copy plugin files from http://github.com/pka/rack-monitor/tree/master/munin/ to /etc/munin/plugins/
